<p class="lead">Phproject is maintained as an open source project for use by anyone around the world. If you find a bug or would like to see a new feature added, feel free to <a href="https://github.com/Alanaktion/phproject/issues/new" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create an issue on Github</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Alanaktion/phproject/compare/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submit a pull request</a> with new code.</p>
<p>In order to ease debugging, change the <code>DEBUG</code> value to 3 in <code>config.ini</code>. In addition to giving more detail on error pages, level 3 enables displaying a query log in the page footer that includes query times and shows which queries were cached.</p>

<h2 id="translations">Translations</h2>
<p>Phproject is translated by our wonderful community on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://crowdin.com/project/phproject/">Crowdin</a>. If you would like to help with translations, contribute either directly to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://crowdin.com/project/phproject/">our dictionary on Crowdin</a>, or translate our demo site in-context at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://translate.phproject.org/">translate.phproject.org</a>. If a language you want to translate to is not listed in our Crowdin project, please <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/Alanaktion/phproject/issues/new">open an issue on GitHub</a> and we'll add the language.</p>

<h2 id="code-standards">Code Standards</h2>
<p>In order to keep things clean and consistent, we follow the PSR-2 standard for PHP formatting. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files should use 4 spaces for indentation.</p>

<p>Be sure to keep indentation clean and consistent with the rest of the project as well, as it makes finding a particular block of code much easier. These standards should be used whenever contributing to the main project or when writing a plugin for Phproject.</p>

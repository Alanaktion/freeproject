	<p class="lead">Phproject plugin support is still under development, but so far, here's how we think it will work:</p>
	<p>A plugin can either be a single PHP file containing a single class, or a directory containing a <code>base.php</code> file, which includes the main class.</p>
	<p>Plugins must have a <code>_load()</code> method in the main class, which returns the hooks the plugin will use, as well as it's metadata.</p>
	<p>Plugins should have a comment block at the start of the file containing at least the plugin name and developer's name, in a standard, easily parsed format.</p>
	<p>Plugins may have an <code>_installed()</code> method which returns a boolean value specifying whether the plugin has been installed correctly. This should include checks such as required database tables and server configuration options, and should cache a <code>TRUE</code> result using Fat Free's caching abstraction layer to improve performance on subsequent requests after installation has succeeded. <span class="text-muted">Or should the caching handled on the Phproject side? That seems like the better option to me now &mdash;<a class="nolink" href="https://github.com/Alanaktion" target="_blank">Alanaktion</a></span></p>
	<p>Plugins may have a <code>routes.ini</code> file if they are in a directory, which will be automatically loaded if the plugin's <code>_installed()</code> method returns <code>TRUE</code>, which must route plugin-specific paths to the correct actions within the plugin's main class or sub-classes.</p>
	<p>Plugins may have a <code>database.sql</code> file if they are in a directory, which will be automatically loaded if the plugin's <code>_installed()</code> method returns <code>FALSE</code>, which must include the SQL queries to add the required database tables and rows for the plugin to operate.</p>
	<p>Plugins may have a <code>_install()</code> method, which will be called if <code>_installed()</code> returns false.</p>

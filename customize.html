	<p>Phproject's UI is built around <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Twitter Bootstrap 3</a>, and is compatible with customized Bootstrap styles including Bootswatch. Simply change the <code>site.theme</code> entry in <code>config.ini</code> to the web path of a Bootstrap CSS file and it will replace the main CSS. Phproject already includes all of the themes from Bootswatch as well as a few custom ones we've built ourselves based on Bootswatch's Flatly. Phproject's additions to the Bootstrap core are designed to add features without breaking any existing components, so unless your customized Bootstrap is very heavily modified, everything should continue to work consistently. Dark themes are known to have a few issues, if you need to use a dark theme, include <a href="#dark-css">the CSS below</a> to ensure everything looks right.</p>
	<p>To give your site a custom title and meta description, update the <code>site.name</code> and <code>site.description</code> entries in <code>config.ini</code>.</p>
	<p>You can also customize the default user image that is shown when a user does not have a Gravatar (Phproject uses <code>mm</code> by default) as well as the maximum content rating of Gravatars to show (<code>pg</code> by default). The <code>gravatar.default</code> and <code>gravatar.rating</code> entries in config.ini can be updated to change these.</p>

# Contributing to Phproject

## Issues

Found a bug, or want to request a new feature? Great! Just make sure there isn't an existing issue before creating a new one, and try to provide as much detail as possible.

## Pull Requests

Thanks for contributing! We have a few basic guidelines for helping us accept your pull requests.

1. New translations should be added on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/phproject) rather than through a pull request.
2. Code style should follow the [PSR-12 standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/).
3. New features may be best implemented through [a plugin](https://www.phproject.org/plugins.html) rather than into the core code.
